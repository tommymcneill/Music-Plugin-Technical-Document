          <h1>Introduction</h1>

          <p>Solo Piano is a cross-platform, virtual instrument created in mind for music producers who need an on-the-go 
          small and lightweight piano plugin that is intended to sound great placed over the top of busy mixes. 
          It has one purpose, to sound great over the top of bands and busy recordings. Most VST plugins and piano sounds
          on the market struggle to cut through a mix without some extra processing. </p>
          <br>
          

          
         <p>This is why Solo Piano was created. Out of the box, it is designed to sound great over busy mixes. 
          This instrument was created by Tommy Solo, a keyboard player who has experimented for years collecting
          and playing keyboards live, experimenting and hand picking the best keyboard sounds in order to craft piano solos 
          over the top of songs.</p>
           <br> 
          
         <p>After trialling thousands of presets and searching through many keyboards and pianos, the creators found
          that it is very rare for a piano sound to cut through a crowded and busy song. Most keyboard presets sound great
          for the purpose of a piano only recording, however in a full track are underwhelming, 
          Many presets are designed to sound great in a classical recording, but when you add the crashing drums and a heavy
          wall of guitar sound, it is hard for many sounds to really do the job. </p>
          <br>
          
          <p>Therefore, a specific piano has been expertly selected
          to be sampled in order to sit perfectly over mixes for this virtual instrument. </p>
          <br>
   
          
          Inside a DAW environment (for example, Logic, Ableton, Pro Tools), you can access this virtual piano to construct piano lines
          over your songs.  </p>

   <section class="main-section" id="#Solo_feature">
    <h1>Solo Feature</h1>
    <p>The Solo feauture is a knob that effectively widens or narrows the piano sound. For a good solid, knocking piano solo,
      you may wish to make use of this knob. Ideally, for a piano part that is playing accompaniment, where the piano needs to sit 
      with the drums, as more of a background element, you would want the Solo knob to be more towards the left.
    </br>

      For a piano solo where the focus of the song moves to the piano, where you would want the piano recording to peak over
      the drums and have a strong focus and clarity to the sound, you would want to switch the "Solo" knob all the way to the right. 
      This should put your piano at the center of the mix and give it predominance. 
    </p>

   <section class="main-section" id="#Reverb_knobs">
    <h1>Reverb Knobs</h1>
    <p>To get started with the reverb knobs, open the instrument and begin experimenting. The reverbs are taken from one
      of the creators secret boards, a very popular industry keyboard from the 2000s. Apply this knob and make your piano solo float 
      even more over the top of the mix. 
    </p>
    <code>reverb knob left = off  <br/>reverb knob right = on </code>
    <p>Enjoy making use of the reverb! </p>
